# Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation files that have been archived during the OpenAPI Documentation Consolidation Project (December 2025).

## Archive Categories

### `/subscription-consolidation/`
Files that were consolidated into the unified [SUBSCRIPTION_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md](../SUBSCRIPTION_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md):

- **DAILY_SUBSCRIPTION_QUICK_START.md** - Quick start guide for daily testing (now in unified guide)
- **SUBSCRIPTION_TESTING_SUMMARY.md** - Testing summary (consolidated)
- **SUBSCRIPTION_WEBHOOK_TESTING_PLAN.md** - Webhook testing plan (consolidated)
- **WEBHOOK_HANDLER_ANALYSIS.md** - Webhook analysis (consolidated)
- **SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN_CHANGES_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Implementation details (consolidated)
- **SUBSCRIPTION_TESTING_HANDOFF_2025-11-29.md** - Handoff documentation (consolidated)

**Reason for archival:** All content from these files has been integrated into the comprehensive [SUBSCRIPTION_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md](../SUBSCRIPTION_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md), which provides a unified reference for all subscription-related functionality.

### `/outdated-designs/`
Design documents that were superseded by current implementation:

- **unified-api-design.md** - Proposed unified file management API design

**Reason for archival:** This design proposal was not implemented. The current file management system uses a different approach documented in the [API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](../API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md).
