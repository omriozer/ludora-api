## Option 2: If you have AWS CLI working

Run this single command (it does everything):
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-script/setup.sh | bash
```

## Option 3: Share AWS Account Access

If you want me to set it up for you:
1. Go to IAM â†’ Users â†’ Create user: `claude-setup-helper`
2. Attach policy: `AdministratorAccess` (temporary)
3. Create access key and share with me
4. I'll set everything up and delete the helper user

**Security note**: Only do this if you trust me with temporary admin access.

- Bucket name (e.g., `ludora-files-20240922`)
